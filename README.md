# Bicycle-Rental-Service
Bicycle is used by a lot of citizens in the United Kingdom as a means of transportation. It is one of the most common means of transportation in the country due to it's low cost and it’s accessibility.
On this note, I’m going to extract data from bicycle hires and rental services data warehouse compiled by the London bicycle hire and rental service company in the public database using BigQuery. The dataset contains information on the usage of bicycle rental service by the citizens.
